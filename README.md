## Lease Finder
An easy-to-use web app that bridges the gap between students who are trying to sublease and students looking for a temporary place to stay.
This web app allows landlords to promote their properties and keep their property information up to date.
Students are able to filter/sort through available listings and see reviews for properties they are interested in.

This project was completed by my team and I for a web app course. 
This web app was built using Ruby on Rails, and utilized Ruby, JavaScript, ERB, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

### How to Run Web App
1. Clone Repository
2. Enter directory `leaseFinder/`
3. Run `bundle install` to install any missing gems
4. Run command `rake db:migrate` to build the database
5. Run command `rake db:reset` to get the seed data
6. Visit `localhost:3000` in Firefox, and you should be on our home page

### How to Execute Test Cases
Testing documentation is written in text files in the `leaseFinder/test/` directory

You can also run our unit tests by going to the `leaseFinder` directory and using the command `rails test`
